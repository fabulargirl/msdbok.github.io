# Abstract

Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a widely recognized framework for managing software development processes; however, its complexity and perceived rigidity often limit its application in small teams. This study explores the potential of adapting RUP to the unique needs of small teams by investigating opportunities to combine roles and streamline processes. By examining the phases and roles within RUP, the research aims to develop practical recommendations for optimizing and implementing RUP in resource-constrained environments while preserving its structured methodology and established best practices.

Currently, this framework comprises more than eighty artifacts, one hundred and fifty activities and about forty roles [4].
# 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Motivation

In today's world, it is often small teams, especially startups, that develop complex, innovative products. Also under the concept of small team we can consider a separate team of a large corporation that works on a separate product. Usually, such teams have problems with structuring, as well as flexibility.
Rational Unified Process (RUP) is already a classic software development methodology. This methodology is often used in large and complex projects. However, the canonicity of the RUP organization requires a large development team.

**Lack of organization** 
Usually, small teams either do not use a specific development process and work as they have to with minimal plans. Or they use Agile without going into the details of the entire framework. Because of this, there is usually chaos in teams, especially if it is an inexperienced team or a student startup. RUP is a fairly classic framework that integrates well into different projects.

**High quality requirements**
RUP is focused on documentation testing, verification of requirements. The presence of managers and analysts ensures the minimization of errors in development. 

**Risk managmment** 
In Agile, risk management is implicit, which is suitable for projects with a low degree of uncertainty. At RUP, risk management is built into the process and integrated into each phase. For small teams that may not have specialized risk managers, and also do not have a large budget to which they can easily part, this can be critically important.

**Adaptability** 
Despite the reputation of a "heavy-handed" methodology, RUP can be adapted. Small teams can select only those disciplines and artifacts that are necessary for their specific project. This approach allows you to reduce excessive workload while maintaining the advantages of structure and formal control.

**Synergy of Agile and RUP** 
Small teams are not required to completely abandon Agile. RUP can be integrated with Agile, maintaining an iterative approach and flexibility, but adding RUP elements to structure processes. For example, you can use a clear initiation phase from RUP to formalize requirements, and then move on to flexible iterations.
## 1.2 Problem Statement

RUP is often criticized for its complexity and heavy, which is why it is often excluded by small teams, preferring Agile metodologies. The following issues will be addressed in this work:
1. Advantages of RUP
2. Reduction/consolidation of roles in RUP
3. Integration of RUP with lighter methodologies

In this paper, I want to propose my own version of RUP integration into small teams, based on the related works. This can be achieved by minimizing duplication of functions and combining roles. It is also worth finding a balance between flexibility and a clear structure.

# 2 Related Work

Borges, Monteiro, and Machado [1] propose a tailored version of RUP specifically designed for small development teams, reducing the number of roles while maintaining essential responsibilities. This study introduced the "Base Model," which simplifies RUP’s 39 original roles into 13 essential roles by merging related tasks and responsibilities. This approach aims to address the resource limitations of small teams while preserving the critical functions necessary for high-quality software development​.

Monteiro et al. [2] provide a tailored configuration of RUP that simplifies its adoption by small teams. The authors propose a reduced model of RUP roles, condensing the original 39 roles into 8 essential roles by combining responsibilities and eliminating redundancies. This approach ensures that all critical functions of the software development process are preserved while addressing the limitations of small teams. The reduced model emphasizes role versatility and pragmatism, allowing small teams to operate effectively without overwhelming complexity or excessive documentation​.

The work by Hirsch [6] explores how RUP can be integrated with Agile practices to create a lighter, more adaptable process without compromising on procedural rigor. Hirsch emphasizes the potential of combining RUP with Agile methodologies to enhance flexibility, suggesting that Agile practices like iterative development and self-organizing teams can complement RUP’s structured framework​.

Researchers such as Hanssen and Westerheim [5] argue that excessive documentation and long development cycles can burden small teams. To mitigate these challenges, they propose pre-tailored RUP configurations, which minimize documentation requirements and streamline the development process​.

This paper builds on these findings, exploring further adaptations of RUP to meet the needs of small development teams while maintaining the balance between structure and flexibility.
# 3 Discussion

## 3.1  Advantages of RUP

The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a software development process developed by Rational Rose, which is now part of IBM [3]. The process is based on an iterative approach. The process is broken down into iterative cycles, which provides adaptability to change. RUP is aimed at ensuring the quality of software products, which emphasises the focus on architecture and risk management. The clear delineation of roles and the emphasis on documentation emphasise the sustainability of the product being created.

RUP consists of four phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition, each of which contains iterations that result in finished artefacts [3]. The Inception phase includes requirements gathering, key risk analysis, Product Vision formation and project architecture building. In the Elaboration phase, the prototype architecture is finalised and a detailed project plan is created. The Construction phase is responsible for code development and code testing. The Transition phase involves the final version of the product with full integration. All phases include several iterations, which allows to finalise the system and reduce risks.

## 3.2 Reduction/consolidation of roles in RUP

The classic RUP development process requires a large team because of the large number of roles. In order to integrate this process into a small development team, the number of roles has to be solved first. In the studied works RUP roles were reduced from 39 original roles to 13 [1] or 8 [2]. Having analysed them I would like to propose a RUP model reduced to 6-7 roles:
### 3.2.1 Project Manager

This role combines: Project Manager, Business-Process Analyst, Change Control Manager, Deployment Manager, Review Coordinator. These should be combined as small teams often do not have a dedicated change or business analyst, so the project manager can take on these roles. Change management is closely related to project management and requirements analysis can be integrated into the planning and task management process.

**Main tasks:**
- Project, time and resource management
- Business process analysis and change management
- Preparing and coordinating product deployment
- Conducting internal and external reviews
- Organising team interaction with customers and other stakeholders

### 3.2.2 Business Analyst

This role combines: Requirements Specifier, Use Case Engineer, Use Case Specifier, Business Designer. In a small team, an analyst can combine work with requirements, documents and customer communications. Use cases are part of the requirements, so it is not appropriate to separate them into a separate role. It is inappropriate to include Business-Process Analyst in this role, as this task is better suited to Project Manager. In this case, the Business Analyst acts as an assistant to the manager so that he or she is not overwhelmed by a large number of tasks in which the manager can get bogged down. Team management and requirements gathering should be separated. 

**Main Tasks:**
- Gathering and analysing system requirements
- Development and documentation of use cases
- Modelling of business processes and their optimisation
- Participate in requirements testing to identify potential problems
- Ensuring that the entire team understands the requirements
### 3.2.3 Team Lead

This role combines: Integrator, Software Architect, Capsule Designer, Code Reviewer, Architecture Reviewer. These roles are combined because these roles are closely related to the design and technical implementation of the system. In a small team, one role can be successfully responsible for architectural design and coordination of component integration. The architect is responsible for the macro level of the system and the integrator is responsible for the integration of its parts, so it is logical to combine their tasks. Team lead is the ‘brain’ of the whole development, this role is responsible for designing all system components and checking the work of other developers.

**Main tasks:**
- Developing and managing the system architecture
- Coordinating the integration of components
- Designing pods and interactions between modules
- Conducting code reviews and architectural reviews to ensure compliance with standards
- Resolving complex technical issues, including tool and technology selection

### 3.2.4 Implementer

This role combines: Implementer, Component Engineer, Design Reviewer, Database Designer. This role does a great job of directly developing the product. The Implementer works under the direction of the Team Lead, who does the review of their work. But the Implementer also performs architecture reviews that the Team Lead does. These two roles complement each other perfectly.

**Main tasks:**
- Implementing functionality and writing code
- Development and support of individual system components
- Design and implementation of databases
- Design review
- Participation in algorithm development and optimisation

### 3.2.5 Tester

This role combines: Test Manager, Test Designer, Integration Tester, System Tester, Test Analyst. In small teams, the tester is often responsible not only for test execution, but also for test planning and documentation. A test manager becomes a separate role only in large projects with many testers, so in this case it is better to combine it with a tester.

**Main tasks:**
- Planning and management of testing processes
- Development of test cases and their execution
- Conducting integration and system testing
- Analysing and documenting test results
- Ensuring that the product quality meets the specified requirements

### 3.2.6 DevOps (Extra)

This role combines: Configuration Manager, System Administrator. These roles are categorised as ‘extra’ because these tasks can also be performed by an Implementer. Сonfiguration and versioning management is often automated using CI/CD tools, reducing manual work. Developers are already familiar with version control tools (e.g. Git), making them suitable candidates for these tasks. This role should be allocated separately depending on the size of the project and the Implementer's workload.

**Main tasks:**
- Version management and configuration of CI/CD processes
- Supporting the development and testing infrastructure
- Ensuring smooth operation of development tools and environments
- Managing data backup and system configuration

### 3.2.7 User-Interface Designer (Extra)

This role combines: User-Interface Designer, Graphic Artist, Course Developer. In smaller projects, a UI designer usually develops not only UX but also visual elements, as these tasks are interrelated. This role belongs to the ‘’extra’ category, as often the customer may come with a ready-made product design.

**Main tasks:**
- Designing user interfaces with UX/UI principles in mind
- Creation of graphic elements required for the product
- Developing training materials for users and employees
- Maintaining the visual style and brand of the product

## 3.3 Integration of RUP with lighter methodologies

For small teams, it is not enough to reduce the number of roles in development. Due to the large number of tasks, a person can perform poorly, which can eventually lead the project to failure. To avoid this, RUP processes should also be redesigned a bit. 

In RUP, the Inception and Elaboration phases are ideal for starting a project, especially for inexperienced teams. It allows you to clearly define the goals and vision of the project, generate high-level requirements, and assess project risks. It also helps to prepare the plan: define milestones, key deliverables and resources. To simplify it, you should keep it short and limit it to 1-2 weeks. You should integrate a Scrum-style approach to form a Product Backlog without writing out the full requirements specification. At this stage the necessary artefacts such as Vision Document and Use Cases are generated, their implementation should be kept but a lighter specification should be used.

After the Inception phase, Agile approaches can be used to improve the iterative nature of product development. The project should be divided into small iterations of 2-4 weeks. At each iteration you should create increments of the product that can be tested and demonstrated. Use Agile principles to quickly adapt to changes in requirements by integrating sprints. Each sprint should achieve the goals that were set in the Product Vision Document.

In this way the initial stages of RUP will help to mitigate risks and structure all stages of development. Further integration of Agile will allow to remain agile and and respond quickly to changes.
# 4 Conclusions

This study explored the adaptation of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) for small software development teams, addressing challenges posed by the framework's complexity and rigidity. By analyzing existing research and practices, a tailored approach was proposed, focusing on reducing the number of roles, streamlining processes, and integrating Agile principles to maintain flexibility.

The proposed model consolidates RUP’s original 39 roles into 6–7 versatile roles that align with the resource constraints of small teams while preserving the framework’s structured methodology. Additionally, the integration of Agile practices within RUP phases, such as combining the Inception phase with Agile-style backlog creation, ensures both structure and adaptability.

This hybrid approach allows small and inexperienced teams to leverage RUP’s strengths, such as risk management and documentation, while addressing their need for agility and rapid iteration. Future work could include the practical application and evaluation of this model in real-world settings to refine the balance between formal process and team flexibility.
